### Front End Technologies Course Assignment for Noroff
This is my submission to the FET CA at Noroff Fagskole
### Project Details

```
for this project I had to create 5 JavaScript files: aboutMe.js, accessibility.js, contact.js, table.js and welcome.js. The rest of the files have been made by my teachers at Noroff.
The JavaScript files had to make changes to the HTML file provided in the project folder. I had to use some Vanilla JavaScript, as well as more advanced jQuery and some CSS to make the changes asked in the task brief.
To install the application, you need to download all the files, and run the index.html file from your program.
The last changes made to this project was 21.05.2023.
I started the project by making the 5 JavaScript files asked in the brief. I spent many hours reading the modules to find relevant codes that could fit the brief. 3 of the js files were easily completed by information from just the modules, and I could rewrite the codes to fit the brief. Some of the codes were harder to find, and I had to use my good friends Google and YouTube. I especially struggled with the table.js and contact.js files, as I could not find exactly what I was looking for.
In the table.js file I could not get the images to load with links in the table, and after many tries, I had to download the images I was trying to open with links and put them in the project folder. For some reason when I used links the webpage would not load at all, and not even refresh. the links also caused me to only be able to click on something once before the webpage stopped working completely. After 1 day of trying to solve this, I tried to download them and open them from the folder, which so far, I believe have fixed the issue with the table.js file. This is the only bug I experienced that sometimes after you clicked something in the table, everything else is not clickable and refreshing doesn't work. Hopefully you don't experience this issue and the problem is finally resolved. 
I don't think any licences have been used for this project.
